# Accounts

The core features of the Epirus Platform can be used without having an account. However, in order to use the Epirus 
Portal, you must have created one.

Epirus Portal accounts enable you to:

- Use Epirus faucets to receive testnet funds
- Deploy and interact with smart contracts without having an Ethereum node
- Access the Epirus Explorers for the public Ethereum networks
