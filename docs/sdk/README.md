# Introduction

The Epirus SDK is the developer toolkit for Epirus.

There are two key components of it that are used to power developers on Ethereum blockchains.

- The CLI is the entrypoint for most users, which facilitates a number of different tasks including project generation and deployment.
- The underlying development library, Web3j which provides all of the technical plumbing for the CLI as well as code integration with the Ethereum Blockchain.

## CLI

Some of the key features of the Epirus CLI are:

- New project creation
- Project creation from existing Solidity code
- Wallet management
- Generation of Solidity smart contract wrappers
- Generation of unit tests for Java smart contract wrappers
- Smart contract auditing

## Web3j

Web3j was created by and continues to be actively maintained by the Web3 Labs team. It is a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) 
integration library for Ethereum. It supports Java, Android, Kotlin and Scala developers.

The Web3j project has extensive developer documentation available at [docs.web3j.io](https://docs.web3j.io).
